== Description ==

Generally while providing the support for the end user most of the times the issue is with 3rd party plugins.

While checking which plugin was creating a conflict, We first note all the active plugins. Then deactivate all plugins, manually activate 1 by 1 plugins. And finally knowing which plugin was creating the cofnlict we activate all the plguins on users website which was we listed before.

The plugin "Plugin Status - Export and Import" help us to export the list of all plugin with there active and inactive status.

We can use the exported JSON file to re-set the active and inactive plugins.
